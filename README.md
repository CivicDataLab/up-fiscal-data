## Background

### CivicDataLab
CivicDataLab ([CDL](https://civicdatalab.in/)) works with the goal to use data, tech, design and social science to strengthen the course of civic engagements in India. We work to harness the potential of open-source movement to enable citizens to engage better with public reforms. We aim to grow data and tech literacy of governments, nonprofits, think-tanks, media houses, universities etc to enable data-driven decision making at scale. 

### OpenBudgetsIndia
CDL, in partnership with Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability ([CBGA](https://www.cbgaindia.org/)), developed Open Budgets India ([OBI](https://openbudgetsindia.org/)), a comprehensive and user-friendly open data portal that can facilitate free, easy and timely access to relevant data on government budgets in India. The portal provides budget information of different tiers of government in India (Union Budget, State Budgets, and Budgets of several Municipal Corporations across the country) in accessible and open (non-proprietary) formats.

### Girl Education
CDL is also partnering with HAQ: Centre for Child Rights ([HAQ-CRC](https://www.haqcrc.org/)) on a project to strengthen financial accountability towards girl education in Uttar Pradesh. The project aims at monitoring the financing of education related scheme with a special focus on promoting girl education in the state. This project will serve as a tool to measure the progress towards SDG Goal 4 & 6 and will also strengthen accountability measures in public financing of education by creating a knowledge pool which will further help policy making to promote girl education.

## Methodology
With regards to the projects mentioned above and beyond, CDL is conducting the exercise of scoping and extracting the related fiscal data for the state of Uttar Pradesh.
