## Map and Clean Schemes' Data

In this document, we will try to find out only those schemes which are classified on the basis of its type as well as declares the mode of benefit of transfer. 
This will finally give us a final dataset of schemes which will help us discern the educational expenditure scenario in Uttar Pradesh.

## How can we achieve this?

1) We scrapped two sets of data: 

[Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NxPfBjU9QD2y8f-EEAX9TMgOuK1T3err/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115911029203465889168&rtpof=true&sd=true)
                                 
[Classification](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lB9C6dZIJZErvjn4wwSXCK_qtyAOP9JY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107918389837609878151&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**Data** : This contains all the schemes which are active in the educational expenditure of the government.
**Classification** : This is a master sheet of all the scheme names along with its classification type and mode of benefit of transfer.

2) After this, we shall merge both these sheets and perform data munging it to get the final dataset.
